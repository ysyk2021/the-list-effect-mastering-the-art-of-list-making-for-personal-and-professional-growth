Use labels like "High Priority," "Medium Priority," and "Low Priority" to categorize your tasks effectively, and consider using techniques like time-blocking or calendar blocking to allocate your time and resources more effectively.

Make sure to take breaks and prioritize self-care activities like exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature, to maintain your energy levels and focus over time.
